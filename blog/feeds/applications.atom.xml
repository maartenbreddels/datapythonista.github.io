Setting up the environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doing some trivial changes to your project structure, can avoid you of translating many string (the ones that are already translated in Django, or in any external application).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For achieving it, my tip is to copy Django itself, and all external applications to your project path, not in a PYTHONPATH directory. It can also avoid compatibility problems, and version conflicts if you're working on several  projects. Then your project root will contain something like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt;.py&lt;br/&gt;settings.py&lt;br/&gt;urls.py&lt;br/&gt;django/&lt;br/&gt;transdb/&lt;br/&gt;myapp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next step is  patching Django (while it's not included in trunk) to omit the inclusion of already translated applications into your project. Here is the &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/attachment/ticket/7916/7916_v2.diff"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;, and you can also see &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7050"&gt;#7050&lt;/a&gt; for further information, or know the status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, when executing &lt;em&gt;./manage.py makemessages&lt;/em&gt; you'll find in your project catalogs, just strings that aren't previously translated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Creating string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have a correct literal creation policy, then your translator will have extra work, problems, and your translation won't be as correct as it should.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thing to do is write literals thinking in reusability (as  software reusability but for translations). I'll show it with some examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% trans 'product' %}&lt;br/&gt;{% trans 'Product' %}&lt;br/&gt;{% trans 'product:' %}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you'll create 3 different string in your translation. Using&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% trans 'product' %}&lt;br/&gt;{{ &lt;em&gt;("product")|capfirst }}&lt;br/&gt;{% trans 'product' %}:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;will create just one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thing to consider is that some times  you consider that a word has just one meaning, or at least you don't think that could be translated using different words. But actually, when translating it to another language it can be converted to different words depending on the context. Let's use an example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; football&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; the guitar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably for most native English  speakers &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; doesn't have more than a subtle difference in two sentences, but if I translate it as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;("play") -&amp;gt; jugar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you'll find something like&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Play football -&amp;gt; Jugar a  futbol (what's correct)&lt;br/&gt;Play the guitar -&amp;gt; Jugar con la guitarra (what means "To have fun with the guitar", probably without generating any sound)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be avoided most times, because usually we don't translate word my word, but there are few cases where we do that, and you should consider doing something like that in that case (actually I never had to do it :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;("play &lt;!-- an instrument --&gt;")&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;("play &lt;!-- a sport --&gt;")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then when you translate into Spanish:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;"play &lt;!-- an instrument --&gt;" -&amp;gt; "tocar"&lt;br/&gt;"play &lt;!-- a sport --&gt;" -&amp;gt; "jugar"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I would also translate English into English:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;"play &lt;!-- an instrument --&gt;" -&amp;gt; "play"&lt;br/&gt;"play &lt;!-- a sport --&gt;" -&amp;gt; "play"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be infinite cases that will generate issues when translating, and it'll be impossible to control everyone. I just wanted to give some tips focused to Django applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Translating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article isn't intended to explain how to translate (I think that there is a degree at university for it ;) . But may be you should give some tips/explanations to your translators for better results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thing you should explain them is how to work with some special cases in your strings. Here you have the two mos common examples that they will found:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This is normal text, &lt;big&gt;and this one is bigger&lt;/big&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;"Hello %(name)s"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless you explain them what it means, probably you'll find something like that in you translated string (using Spanish in the example):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Este texto es normal, &lt;grande&gt;y  éste es mayor&lt;/grande&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;"Hola %(nombre)s"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course those translations doesn't generate the expected results, because the correct ones are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;"Este texto es normal, &lt;big&gt;y  éste es mayor&lt;/big&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;"Hola %(name)s"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thing that could be clarified, specially if your translator is involved in the Web site that is being translated (or at least knows the context where every string is used), is not to create translations more specific than the original texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, imagine that you've in your application a form for personal data, and one of the fields is called "name". Then you translate your application to Catalan, and your translator knows when translating "name", that is used as person name, and translate it as "nom propi" (first name). It will look nicer by now, while being incorrect for me, so later may be you'll add a form where you ask corporate information and you have a field "name" for the company name. You won't send the string "name" to the translator again, and your translation will be incorrect, so "nom propi" (first name) is not valid for the company name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Choosing the main language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes it isn't so obvious  the language your application is written in (I mean the language you use inside gettext strings, or trans/blocktrans tags).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're writing an application that will be used widely in the world, and it will be translated to many languages, probably you think that English should be the right language for it, but in some cases there are some questions to take care on.&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Will your company have an international team (specially of Django developers)? If you have workers from many countries, probably English will be good for letting all of them write/read from the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Will your translation team/company use English as it source language? The .po files will show your main language as source for translating string. If you hire a German to French translator, isn't a good idea writing your strings in English, so your/their work will increase a lot, and the reliability of the process will decrease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt; Are your coders fluent in English? It's more complicated (more work) to change a string from a the main language than from a translation. So if your developers can't write correct English, writing literals in their mother tongue language will save time and work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Unluckily some times you'll have conflicts in previous questions, and you'll have to choose the lesser evil.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Applications"></category><category term="Django"></category><category term="IT"></category></entry><entry><title>Django i18n status</title><link href="https://datapythonista.github.io/blog/django-i18n-status.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-26T04:11:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-07-26T04:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Marc</name></author><id>tag:datapythonista.github.io,2008-07-26:/blog/django-i18n-status.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here you have what, from my point of view, is the status of django i18n.

&lt;p&gt;This list is part of the analysis that I'm doing to fix all those problems. If you want to participate in making Django also "The web framework for perfectionists outside the US", please contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Translation (static content)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(127, 255, 0);"&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django has an amazing translation system, easy to use, and exceptionally automated. Also it has bidi support. Despite of this, some problems can be found when translating django or applications to other languages (masculine/femenine...).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Translation (database content)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(220, 20, 60);"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django doesn't support model field translation, but it can be achieved using an external application such as [TransDb](http://code.google.com/p/transdb/), [django-multilingual](http://code.google.com/p/django-multilingual/), [django-utils](http://code.google.com/p/django-utils) translation service and [i18ndynamic](http://code.google.com/p/i18ndynamic/). As far as I know only TransDb and django-multilingual are working on Django's trunk.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Calendar customization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(220, 20, 60);"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Patching Django is required to change first day of week in admin calendar (first day of week is Monday according to ISO and in many countries (most Europe, most South America, and some parts of Asia). See ticket [#1061](http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/1061)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Date format (when displaying)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(127, 255, 0);"&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dates displayed in admin are formatted according to current locale. Also custom dates can be easily formatted using date filter (f.e. {{ my_date|date:_("DATE_FORMAT") }} ).

The problem here, is that few internationalized formats are defined inside django, so using django formats you can internationalize a date with format "December 31th, 2000", but not with format "12/31/2000". It can be achieved creating date formats in your catalog.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Date format (on inputs)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(220, 20, 60);"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django allows specifying one or many input formats for a date form field (using the input_formats parameter of the form field).I think that there is no way to specify the format on the admin fields, specially because the format that generates the calendar is always the same.

Anyway what it's expected is not to specify the format of a field, actually it is to get the format from the current locale.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Number format (when displaying)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(220, 20, 60);"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django has just a filter (floatformat) to format numbers, where you can specify how many decimals you want. It's very difficult to customize your number format, to the format of the current locale, and even to a fixed format.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Number format (on input)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="background-color: rgb(220, 20, 60);"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Django has no way to specify if you want to enter a decimal number with comma separator (dot is always used). Of course it can't be done according to current locale.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

But I also wanted a nice url structure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What it is nice for me, opposite to Django default settings, is avoiding the media prefix on my media urls, so&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://localhost/media/admin/css/login.css would be http://localhost/admin/css/login.cssTrying to emulate old website structures (used widely in php sites).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That could be nice or not, but for sure it is complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step was to setup apache for it, a little bit more complicated than the usual setup, but possible:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;LocationMatch "/((css|js|img|swf|pdf)/|favicon.ico)"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SetHandler None&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main problem comes when using Django development http server (started by "python manage.py runserver"), and the admin. Of course you can do that, but what is not possible, is to define the same name for your admin media path, and for the admin itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://localhost/admin and http://localhost/admin/css/login.css&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason is the Django web server, processes all requests starting with the ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX setting with the AdminMediaHandler, what implies with that structure that all admin requests (even the ones that aren't static files) are processed by this handler, raising an error when the request isn't for a static file. The error is next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission denied: ${PYTHON_PATH}/django/contrib/admin/media/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this is my resignation statement to do what I wanted to do initially. Now, options are:&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Don't use the Django http server (use apache even for development)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Keep the same structure but change the admin media directory (for example from "admin" to "admin-media"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Use the "media" (or any other name) prefix&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Don't forget to import &lt;/em&gt;: f&lt;em&gt;rom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In templates, convert &lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text in english&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;{% trans 'Text in many languages' %}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (also this can be done with blocktrans tag)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go to your project path and create a directory called locale (also you can do that just for an application)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Execute ${PATH_TO_DJANGO}/bin/make-messages -l ${LANGUAGE_CODE} (where language code is en for english, es for spanish...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Edit ${PROJECT_PATH}/locale/${LANGUAGE_CODE}/LC_MESSAGES/django.po and set the &lt;em&gt;msgstr&lt;/em&gt; variables with the translation of every &lt;em&gt;msgid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Run msgfmt django.po -o django.mo (I just realized after the interview that exists a django script complie-messages.py that does that for all .po files)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;li&gt;And then you have your application translated. There are some settings in settings.py that need to be set for making it work (USE_I18N = True, set LANGUAGES and LANGUAGE_CODE, and specify the django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware middleware)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Then probably you'll want to have your select input with all available languages (or something like that). For it you'll have to add &lt;em&gt;(r'^i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n'))&lt;/em&gt; to your urls.py, and from your html send a POST request to &lt;em&gt;/i18n/setlang&lt;/em&gt; with the parameter &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; set to desired language code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;For more stuff, and detailed information check: &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/i18n/"&gt;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/i18n/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that IMHO should be improved in Django for a better L10n expirience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Move localflavors outside trunk (to avoid unnecessary translation costs). Every localflavor should come with necessary translations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Create locale settings (besides translations), to set decimal symbol, date and time format, first day of week... and use it automatically for current locale/language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Check tickets &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/1061"&gt;#1061&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3940"&gt;#3940&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6783"&gt;#6783&lt;/a&gt; that gives different approaches to this problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create translatable CharFields and TextFields. For now &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-multilingual/"&gt;django-multilingual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/transdb/"&gt;transdb&lt;/a&gt; can be used for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Adding something to select the language in admin (when more than one is available).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Haven't checked it too much, but it'll be good if urls could be translated as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally I want to thank for letting me participate in TWID to &lt;a href="http://blog.michaeltrier.com"&gt;Michael Trier&lt;/a&gt;, who is a father, husband, software architect, entrepreneur, a great journalist, and a better person.
